# Welcome to the interactive tree calculus playground!
# Check out the landing page for a wide range of interactive demos.

# To make the tree node operator "â–³" more accessible, it is aliased to "t"
# or can be entered via some subset of Alt-N, Alt-T, Ctrl-N or Ctrl-T (depending on OS and browser).

# Syntactic sugar quick reference:
# - Lambda abstractions "\variable body" desugar via abstraction elimination (combinatory logic)
# - Boolean convention:  false = t  and  true = t t
# - Lists "[ ... ]" desugar to (t ... (t ... (t ... t)))
# - Natural numbers desugar to lists of booleans (binary, LSB as first list element)
# - String constants desugar to lists of natural numbers representing unicode code points
# - ADTs "Foo = Bar | Baz x y" desugar into Scott encoded constructors
# - "$" like in Haskell
